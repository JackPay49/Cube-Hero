This is a snake type game where the aim is to last as long as you can!
In Cube Hero you will appear on the screen at first with a length of 3. You can get points by collecting Powerups. There are 5 different types of Powerup, that each do something different. Some Powerups also give you points!
The main source of points is staying alive. You will earn points every turn you are alive, but note that the larger you are the more points you will earn! Be careful though as if you hit the side of the screen or your own body you will lose!
You can save your game half way through by opening the menu and clicking Save. This save can be continued any time by reloading the game. If you lose the game though your current run will end! You will not lose any points from losing a run. 
The top ten highest scores are recorded within the scoreboard. Your score will be automatically added to this board whenever you save or lose a run!
You can also customise the controls to whatever you prefer by using the Controls window.
