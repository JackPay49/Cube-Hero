# 16321_Python_Coursework

This is the repository for the Python Coursework named: 16321-Cwk-S-Python Coursework
This contains the project Cube Hero, in the file main.py. This repo also contains other coursework made for the Python programming course in the First Year of my degree.
Using Python and the library of Tkinter I worked independently to create a snake game called Cube Hero. I explored how to implement object-oriented programming and used this to make a game including multiple snakes moving around on a single board, controlled by complex logic. I implemented measures such as difficulty to control the speed of the game and the number of enemy snakes on the board at one time.
Cube Hero was a snake game with a twist. You can play as a single snake dodging around other enemy snakes intent on eating you. There's a variety of different apples with diverse effects such as making you grow, speed up or even instantly die. This game also included features such as cheat codes, difficulty levels and customisation of controls.
